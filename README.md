The Finance Tracker App is a Kotlin-based Android application designed to help
users manage their personal finances with ease. It allows customers to add, edit,
and delete income and expense transactions, view their spending patterns
through a dynamic pie chart, and set a monthly budget to monitor financial goals.
The app supports multiple currencies for global usability and includes a data
backup feature to ensure the safety of financial records. All user data,
preferences, and settings are efficiently stored using SharedPreferences,
providing a lightweight and responsive experience without relying on external
databases.
